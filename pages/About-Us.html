      <h2>The Origins of Accessible Design Co. : A Story of Innovation & Inclusion</h2>
    </p>The Origins of Accessible Design Co.: A Story of Innovation & Inclusion
Accessible Design Co. was born from a shared vision between two pioneering minds—Frances "Reagan" James, Ph.D., and Assaf Rappaport. Both deeply committed to breaking barriers in digital accessibility, they saw an urgent need for a more inclusive web, where every individual, regardless of ability, could navigate, interact, and engage seamlessly.
Dr. James, an expert in human-centered design and digital inclusivity, brought a wealth of knowledge in usability research, accessibility standards, and the intersection of technology and social equity. Meanwhile, Rappaport, an acclaimed entrepreneur and tech innovator, had a keen eye for creating scalable, forward-thinking solutions that revolutionized industries.
Their paths crossed through a shared frustration—despite advancements in technology, too many people were being left behind in the digital space. Together, they envisioned a future where accessibility wasn’t just a compliance checkbox, but the foundation of great design. That vision became the blueprint for Accessible Design Co..
What started as a small initiative to educate businesses on web accessibility soon flourished into a leading company driving digital inclusion worldwide. Dr. James and Rappaport assembled a team of passionate designers, engineers, and advocates, all dedicated to creating technology that serves everyone.
Today, Accessible Design Co. stands at the forefront of digital accessibility, working with global brands, developers, and organizations to reshape the digital landscape. Their mission remains unchanged—to ensure the web is open, inclusive, and empowering for all.
Because access isn’t a privilege—it’s a right.</p>
