        <h2>The Origins of Accessible Design Co. : A Story of Innovation & Inclusion</h2>
      </p>The Origins of Accessible Design Co.: A Story of Innovation & Inclusion
  Accessible Design Co. was born from a shared vision between two pioneering minds—Frances "Reagan" James, Ph.D., and Assaf Rappaport. Both deeply committed to breaking barriers in digital accessibility, they saw an urgent need for a more inclusive web, where every individual, regardless of ability, could navigate, interact, and engage seamlessly.
  Dr. James, an expert in human-centered design and digital inclusivity, brought a wealth of knowledge in usability research, accessibility standards, and the intersection of technology and social equity. Meanwhile, Rappaport, an acclaimed entrepreneur and tech innovator, had a keen eye for creating scalable, forward-thinking solutions that revolutionized industries.
  Their paths crossed through a shared frustration—despite advancements in technology, too many people were being left behind in the digital space. Together, they envisioned a future where accessibility wasn’t just a compliance checkbox, but the foundation of great design. That vision became the blueprint for Accessible Design Co..
  What started as a small initiative to educate businesses on web accessibility soon flourished into a leading company driving digital inclusion worldwide. Dr. James and Rappaport assembled a team of passionate designers, engineers, and advocates, all dedicated to creating technology that serves everyone.
  Today, Accessible Design Co. stands at the forefront of digital accessibility, working with global brands, developers, and organizations to reshape the digital landscape. Their mission remains unchanged—to ensure the web is open, inclusive, and empowering for all.
  Because access isn’t a privilege—it’s a right.</p>

<!-- You will design and develop a responsive, multi-section webpage for a fictitious company called Accessible Design Co.. 
<! yet to start  -->

<!-- Your webpage should meet the following criteria:

1. Semantic HTML Structure
Use semantic HTML elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.) to create a clear and meaningful structure.
Ensure that all content is organized hierarchically using proper headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.).

2. Responsive Design Using Flexbox and Grid
Implement a responsive navigation bar using Flexbox that adjusts to smaller screen sizes.
Use CSS Grid to create a multi-column layout for the main content area that collapses to a single column on mobile devices.
Add media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen sizes (e.g., 600px and 1024px breakpoints).

3. Accessibility Features
Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements:
Add role="navigation" to the navigation bar.
Use aria-label or aria-labelledby for labeling interactive elements where necessary.
Include aria-live attributes for dynamically updating content, if applicable.
Ensure that all images have meaningful alt text, and decorative images use alt="".
Design forms with accessible labels and validation feedback:
Use <label> elements associated with each form input.
Add aria-describedby for additional instructions or error messages.
Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management for all interactive elements.

4. Color Contrast and Visual Design
Ensure text has a sufficient contrast ratio against the background (use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker ).
Use CSS to style focus states for interactive elements (e.g., links and buttons) to make them visible when navigated with a keyboard.
