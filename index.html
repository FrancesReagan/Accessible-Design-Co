<!-- You will design and develop a responsive, multi-section webpage for a fictitious company called Accessible Design Co.. 
 Your webpage should meet the following criteria:

1. Semantic HTML Structure
Use semantic HTML elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.) to create a clear and meaningful structure.
Ensure that all content is organized hierarchically using proper headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.).

2. Responsive Design Using Flexbox and Grid
Implement a responsive navigation bar using Flexbox that adjusts to smaller screen sizes.
Use CSS Grid to create a multi-column layout for the main content area that collapses to a single column on mobile devices.
Add media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen sizes (e.g., 600px and 1024px breakpoints).

3. Accessibility Features
Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements:
Add role="navigation" to the navigation bar.
Use aria-label or aria-labelledby for labeling interactive elements where necessary.
Include aria-live attributes for dynamically updating content, if applicable.
Ensure that all images have meaningful alt text, and decorative images use alt="".
Design forms with accessible labels and validation feedback:
Use <label> elements associated with each form input.
Add aria-describedby for additional instructions or error messages.
Ensure proper keyboard navigation and focus management for all interactive elements.

4. Color Contrast and Visual Design
Ensure text has a sufficient contrast ratio against the background (use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker ).
Use CSS to style focus states for interactive elements (e.g., links and buttons) to make them visible when navigated with a keyboard.
